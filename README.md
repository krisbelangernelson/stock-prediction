# stock-prediction
 
## start

`npm run dev`

## Tests

`npm run test`

The app has state setters and values with prop drilling, so unit tests are not that great as a RTL `rerender` has to be used to pass in new values to test for those changes. The whole app is [integration tested with 100% coverage](https://github.com/krisbelangernelson/stock-prediction/commit/7d1a82555505e00b1fe43be514ce90d1fd80c751) in `StockTable.test.tsx` -- or was at 100% prior to adding new features from more of the "Optional Challenges".
