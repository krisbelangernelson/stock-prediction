# stock-prediction
 
## start

`npm run dev`

## Tests

`npm run test`

The app has state setters and values with prop drilling, so unit tests are not that great as a RTL `rerender` has to be done to pass in new values. The whole app is integration tested with 100% coverage in `StockTable.test.tsx`.
